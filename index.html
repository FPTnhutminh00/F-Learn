 </div>
 <div class="description">
    The biggest change currently in CSS3 is the introduction of modules. The advantage of modules is that it allows the property to be completed and approved faster because segments are completed and approved in blocks.<br>
    Features included in CSS3 include support for additional selectors, drop shadows, rounded corners, multiple backgrounds, animations, transparency etc. It contains “CSS properties” (already included). subdivided into smaller parts). There are also new modules added. Some of the most important modules in CSS3 are: <br> 
    - Selector <br>
    - Box model <br>
    - Backgrounds and borders <br>
    - Image value and alternative content <br>
    - Text effects <br>
    - 2D/3D Conversion <br>
    - Animations <br>
    - Multi-column layout <br>
    - User interface <br>

 What is the difference between HTML and HTML5? 
</div>
<div class="description">
    - HTML5 support for more applications: Some applications such as SVG, canvas ... are supported by HTML5, but used in HTML must use additional facilities. <br>
    - Store temporary data: HTML5 uses web SQL databases, application cache, and HTML only uses browser cache.<br>
    - JavaScript running in a web browser: HTML5 fully supports JavaScript running in a web browser, and HTML in older versions is not possible. <br>
    - SGML: Unlike HTML, HTML5 is not based on SGML, so the programming product is more compatible.<br>
    - Using MathML and SVG: HTML5 allows using MathML and SVG for text, but in HTML it is not supported.<br>
    - Elements: HTML5 integrates new and important elements like summary, time, aside, audio, command, data, datalist, details, embed, wbr, figcaption, figure, footer, header, article, hgroup, bdi, canvas, keygen, mark, meter, nav, output, progress, rp, rt, ruby, section, source, track, video... Besides, it also removes obsolete HTML elements like isindex, noframes, acronym, applet, basefont, dir, font, frame, frameset, big, center, strike….
